            <h2>Key Attractions in Shirdi</h2>

            <div class="attraction">
                <h3>1. Shri Sai Baba Samadhi Mandir</h3>
                <p>The main temple where the mortal remains of Shri Sai Baba are enshrined. It is the spiritual heart of Shirdi and the primary reason for most pilgrimages. The atmosphere inside is incredibly serene, filled with devotion and prayers. Darshan (viewing of the deity) can take time, especially during peak seasons, but the experience is truly uplifting.</p>

            <div class="attraction">
                <h3>2. Dwarkamai Masjid</h3>
                <p>This is the mosque where Sai Baba spent a significant part of his life. It holds immense historical and spiritual significance. Inside, you can see the dhuni (sacred fire) lit by Baba, and the grinding stone he used. The simplicity of Dwarkamai reminds visitors of Baba's humble life.</p>

            <div class="attraction">
                <h3>3. Chavadi</h3>
                <p>Located near Dwarkamai, Chavadi is where Sai Baba used to sleep on alternate nights. It's a small, peaceful place that offers a glimpse into Baba's routine. The palanquin procession of Baba's idol from Samadhi Mandir to Chavadi on Thursdays is a sight to behold.</p>

            <div class="attraction">
                <h3>4. Lendi Baug</h3>
                <p>A beautiful garden tended by Sai Baba himself. It houses the "Nanda Deep," an eternally burning lamp lit by Baba. The peaceful ambiance of Lendi Baug makes it an ideal spot for contemplation.</p>

            <div class="attraction">
                <h3>5. Khandoba Mandir</h3>
                <p>This temple is significant because it was at this very place that Mahalsapati, a local priest, first welcomed Sai Baba to Shirdi by calling him "Sai," meaning saint.</p>

            <h2>My Experience</h2>
            <p>My visit to Shirdi was a truly transformative experience. The moment I stepped into the Samadhi Mandir, I felt an overwhelming sense of peace and devotion. Witnessing the devotion of thousands of pilgrims, participating in the aarti, and feeling the presence of Sai Baba at every sacred spot was profoundly moving. The entire town resonates with the teachings of Shraddha (faith) and Saburi (patience), leaving a lasting impression on the heart.</p>
            <p>I highly recommend a visit to Shirdi for anyone seeking spiritual solace and a deeper connection with the divine.</p>
